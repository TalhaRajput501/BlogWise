# 📝 Talha's Blog Website

Welcome to my personal **blog website**!  
This project is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** built as part of my learning journey in full-stack web development using the **MERN stack** and modern tools. I'm not brand new to coding—but I’m constantly leveling up my skills and building projects that reflect what I’m learning.

## 🚀 About the Project

This is a fully functional blog website where users can:

- 📚 View all blog posts (publicly available)
- ✍️ Create, edit, or delete their own blog posts (after logging in)
- 📸 Upload featured images
- 🧠 Write posts using a rich text editor
- 🔐 Secure login and signup system using Appwrite Auth
- 🌙 Enjoy a clean UI with dark theme support

The project is deployed and live, so you can explore it as a real production-grade app!

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React**
- **Redux** (for global state management)
- **React Router DOM**
- **Tailwind CSS** (with dark mode)
- **React Hook Form**
- **Appwrite** (for backend services: database, auth, storage)
- **Vite** (for fast development)
- **Express** (minor backend utilities)

## 👨‍💻 Motivation

I created this blog site to practice:

- Frontend and backend integration
- Authentication and route protection
- Working with Appwrite as a backend-as-a-service
- Clean UI with Tailwind CSS
- Reusable React components and proper code structure

## 📈 What's Next

This is just the beginning! I'm planning to add:

- Comments system
- Likes system
- Post categories & tags
- User profiles
- Better SEO & performance optimization

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

Hi! I'm **Talha**, currently diving deep into the MERN stack.  
I’m building projects to **strengthen my portfolio** and eventually turn my coding skills into income—whether it's through freelance work, monetized apps, or someday… the billionaire😅 coder lifestyle (well, kind of 😉).
